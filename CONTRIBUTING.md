# Contributing to [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a issue
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## All Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add some tests' example.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report issues/bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Share the snapshot, if possible.
- What actually happens
- What you expected would happen
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
